# IDS 385W - Translation: Who, What, How

This seminar examines the realities of translation in multiple settings and contexts. 
Translation is embedded into our everyday lives, central to newsfeeds, religious texts, politics, Netflix and literature. 
Often, however, the phenomenon is unremarked, rendered invisible. Yet embedded within it are decisions with cultural, ethical and political ramifications. 
This course aims to make visible the people, issues and products involved: translators, subtitlers and interpreters; theories, strategies and methodologies; and the written and visual texts they produce. 
To that end, we will examine the history of translation via the Bible; study current issues in the field; and read work by several translators. Topics to include: translation and gender; bible translation; translation and race; LGBTQ issues in translation; subtitling; translators as social and political actors. Readings span fiction, memoir, theory, methodology, history, and journalism. 
Classes are discussion and workshop based and include numerous translation activities: comparing multiple versions of the same work, imitation pieces, translating genre and style, editing, and Oulipo activities. 
The course is taught in English, with no foreign language proficiency required.
