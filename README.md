CS/QTM/LING 329 - Computational Linguistics
=====

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced to the point that it starts interacting with humans in natural language.
This communication ability makes AI an integral part of human society as a collaborator and companion.
Thus, it is essential to understand how AI can (and should) be designed to conduct meaningful conversations with humans.
The main objectives of this course are:

* To discover technical approaches to dialogue systems.
* To conceive manifold use cases of dialogue systems.
* To study effective ways of Human-Computer Interaction.
* To develop a dialogue system using methods in Computational Linguistics.
* To comprehend the limitations of your dialogue system through Statistical Analysis.

Students will have individual assignments and work in groups to build end-to-end dialogue systems of their choice. 
Toward the end of the semester, all teams will present the dialogue systems with live demonstrations.
